<h3>Killers of the Flower moon<br>
5/5
</h3>
<p>Scorsese's done it again. Killers of the Flower Moon is another masterpiece, or close to it. I have next to no complaints. It finds the legendary filmmaker at the top of his game (he's been there since 2013 it seems, with an amazing unbroken streak), telling what might be his bleakest and most emotionally distressing story yet.

<h3>Animal<br>
    4.5/5
</h3>
<p>It's a BLOODSHED BLOCKBUSTER...Ranbir's daring & dashing performance never seen in screen before. Just nailed the role! He is really a versatile actor. He did this with so intensity. Bobby Deol is in beast mode. Rashmika got a decent role. This is a masterpiece by SandeepReddyVanga and Ranbir Kapoor which will remain in everyone's heart for years and years... Remember the name Sandeep Reddy Vanga. All hail pride of our TFI</p>
<h3>Kannur Squad<br>
4/5
</h3>
<p>Kannur Squad is super cinema. Hearty congrats to Mammokka for the Mesmerizing act. You are a super hero. Excellent direction from the beginning till end. A special word of appreciation to the director. Very good background music. Even without romance and songs, the movie is awesome. Wonderful camera. Very beautiful locations. Great team work. Even the villain characters are so great. The storyline is so good. Each character has its own identity. I would like to watch again the movie. </p>
